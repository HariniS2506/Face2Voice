## Inference Pipeline

This folder containes the codes to the evaluation metrics for Face clustering and Voice Generation

## Clustering Evaluation

This contains 3 folders corresponding to our 3 clustering algorithms - KMeans, Agglomerative and DBSCAN. Each of the 3 methods are evaluated based on 3 metrics - Silhouette Score, Calinski harabasz Score (C-H Index), and Davies bouldin Score (DB Index). The steps to carry evaluation for each of the 3 approaches is as given below.
