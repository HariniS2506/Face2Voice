This folder contains the code to fine-tune TTS models

Whisper_STT_and_Coqui_TTS.ipynb contains the script to fine tune the TTS.
For fine tuning a model for each cluster, change the value of sub_dir based on the cluster you are fine tuning for. Accordingly, also change the paths to data and output in the notebook depending on the cluster you are fine-tuning.
